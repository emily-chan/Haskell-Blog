# CPSC 354 Programming Languages
# Haskell Blog

This is a blog and tutorial about Haskell.

My experience is specific to macOS Catalina and may vary from other users.

First, navigate to the [Haskell Installation](Haskell-Installation.md) page.

Visit [Functional Programming](Functional-Programming.md) for a brief introduction to Haskell syntax.

[Lists](Lists.md) contains information about how lists in Haskell, constructing lists, and list operations, along with some examples.

The [Recursion](Recursion.md) page discusses the concept of recursion and how it's used in functional programming.

Go to [BNFC Installation](BNFC-Installation.md) to learn more about how this grammar tool produces abstract syntax implementation, as well as lexer and parser generator files. At first I had some issues, but after searching online and asking for help from my professor I was able to figure it out. This page has more detailed information on my situation and will hopefully be of use to someone else who encounters similar problems.

Pages:
- [Haskell Installation](Haskell-Installation.md)
- [Functional Programming](Functional-Programming.md)
- [Lists](Lists.md)
- [Recursion](Recursion.md)
- [BNFC Installation](BNFC-Installation.md) (requires Haskell installation).
