# Animation

When I studied abroad, I took a Functional Programming class where I learned some Haskell. This class was more focused more the idea of functional programming and using the Haskell language to apply these concepts. Coming into this class, I was unsure of what to expect because it's a Programming Languages class where we learn Haskell, among other languages and topics. Although my knowledge of Haskell was minimal even after taking the Functional Programming class, I think it was helpful for taking Programming Languages because they both emphasize the importance of functional programming in various ways. The Functional Programming class seemed to be more practical and applied whereas the Programming Languages class had a more theoretical and conceptual foundation.

In my Functional Programming class, the lecturer provided an [Animation module](Animation/Animation.hs) and showed us cool animations that could be made. For this blog post, I decided to create one because I thought it would be a fun and interesting way to demonstrate my understanding of list comprehensions and the concept of zip while using a predefined module for animations. I chose to create an [Animation](Animation/MyAnimation.hs) of the [Olympics logo](Animation/animation.svg) that starts off as small circles then becomes larger to form the logo.
